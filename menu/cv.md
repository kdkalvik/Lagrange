# Research Interests
I am interested in Bayesian learning, deep learning, and mathematical optimization. Currently, I am studying sparse Gaussian processes to address crucial problems in robotics, such as generating explainable DNN predictions, sensor placement, multi-robot informative path planning, and learning robot dynamics.

# Research Experience
- **Efficient Multi-Robot Informative Path Planning using Sparse Gaussian Processes**\\
  <span><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Dec 2022--- </span>\\
  Researching sparse Gaussian processes for efficient multi-robot informative path planning. Current results show that my method is an order of magnitude faster than the prior SOTA, thereby enabling real-time deployment on resource-constrained robots

  <span><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> May 2023---Aug 2023 </span>\\
  Pioneered a low size, weight, and power (SWaP)-optimized Bayesian approach to explain black-box pre-trained DNN predictions. The method was capable of efficiently generating example-based explanations, justifications, and quantifying the prediction uncertainty of DNNs

- **Efficient Sensor Placement using Sparse Gaussian Processes**\\
  <span><i class="fa fa-calendar" aria-hidden="true"></i> Jan 2022---Dec 2022 </span>\\
