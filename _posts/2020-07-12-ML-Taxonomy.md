#### Suggestions
If you want to suggest any important/interesting methods/problems not mentioned here or report any mistakes in my taxonomy, you can submit an issue on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kdkalvik/kdkalvik.github.io).

#### Disclaimer
The taxonomy presented here is from my understanding of the topics and might not necessarily represent the correct taxonomy. It is also impossible to describe the relationship between all the methods mentioned here as a directed acyclic graph tree. The taxonomy here is merely one realization of what makes the most sense to me, given my interests and knowledge.
