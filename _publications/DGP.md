## Abstract
Gaussian processes are one of the dominant approaches in Bayesian learning. Although the approach has been applied to numerous problems with great success, it has a few fundamental limitations. Multiple methods in literature have addressed these limitations. However, there has not been a comprehensive survey of the topics as of yet. Most existing surveys focus on only one particular variant of Gaussian processes and their derivatives. This survey details the core motivations for using Gaussian processes, their mathematical formulations, limitations, and research themes that have flourished over the years to address said limitations. Furthermore, one particular research area is Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs), it has improved substantially in the past decade. The significant publications that advanced the forefront of this research area are outlined in their survey. Finally, a brief discussion on open problems and research directions for future work is presented at the end.
